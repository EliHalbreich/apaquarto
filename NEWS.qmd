# Future Version Wishlist

- Create landscape pages for wide figures and tables.
- Figure and Tables in .pdf jou mode should fit automatically.
- Typst version that would allow for easy customization

# Version 3.2.0 (2024-02-13)

- Added support for masked references.

# Version 3.1.0 (2024-02-09)

- The `floatsintext` option now works in docx and html. Setting it to `true`, intermingles text, figures, and tables. Setting it to `false` moves all figures and tables to the end of the document.

# Version 3.0.0 (2024-01-20)

The main goal for version 3 was to do everything with lua filters instead of R. It was quite a journey, but apaquarto is now completely independent of R, which should help folks working with other languages.

## Breaking changes

* The the `apafg-` and `apatb-` prefixes are no longer used for figures and tables. Use the standard Quarto prefixes (`fig-` and `tbl-`), as well as the standard quarto referencing syntax (e.g,. `@fig-myplot` will reference the `fig-myplot` chunk.). 
*  The include statement below the metadata is no longer used and must be deleted. An informative error will provide instruction if the include statement remains. 

## Improvements

### .docx

- The title page and abstract page are now processed using lua filters instead of R.
- The officer package is no longer required to create a new reference document every time the document is rendered. Now, a lua filter looks for the `shorttitle` field in your yaml. If that is not found, the `title` and `subtitle` fields are used instead. The running header is assigned to the `description` field in the quarto metadata. This value will show up in the `Comments` field in the rendered .docx file, which is then inserted into the field box in the header.
- The .docx running header is set with a lua filter and a docx field that draws from the .docx metadata. 

### .pdf

- The jou (journal) mode in .pdf is better supported. There are a few hacky solutions that need a bit of work. 

# Version 2.0.0 (2023-11-10)

- Many small fixes
- Support for .html and .pdf became more solid.
- CReditT taxonomy added for author roles.

# Version 1.0.0 (2023-03-05)

Initial release. Basic functions worked, but relied on many hacks that I always intended to fix. Mostly just for .docx, but .html and .pdf supported to some degree.

- Most of the title page information was processed in R because I did not  understand lua. UPDATE: As of version 3.0.0, all of the R code that used to be inserted, is not longer used. The lua filters take care of everything in the .html and .docx formats.
- Because I did not yet understand lua and Quarto, I processed figures and tables differently in a non-standard way. I wrestled with Quarto, but I could not stop it from formatting the captions the way it wanted to. Finally I gave up and processed them with non-standard syntax and knitr hooks. UPDATE: This was always intended to be a temporary solution. As of version 3.0.0, all non-standard syntax is gone. 
- The ability to put simple markdown notes below figures and tables was important to me. The tricky part was to get them to travel with the figures and tables when they were part of floats or when they moved to the end of the document. Many headaches later, it works using the `apa-note` chunk option or `apa-note` as a custom attribute of a fenced div. 
- APA level 4 and 5 headings should remain as true headings that appear in the navigation tab in MS Word. Yet they appear as if they are in the same paragraph with subsequent text. This feature was implemented with apaquarto.lua filter that inserts openxml tags in the headers: 

````
```openxml
<w:vanish/><w:specVanish/>
```
````

This creates a *Style Separator* character that you can see in MS Word by clicking the Show/Hide Â¶ button. BTW, the CTRL+ALT+Enter keyboard shortcut in Word will insert a style separator. See https://www.cadmanediting.com/the-style-separator-a-hidden-gem-in-ms-word
