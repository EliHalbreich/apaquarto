    "text": "The ability to automate APA style via \\(\\LaTeX\\) has been around for some time—first via apa (APA Style, 5th Edition), then via apa6 (APA Style, 6th Edition), and now via apa7 (APA Style, 7th Edition). The apaquarto package uses apa7 to create .pdf documents. To intermingle R code and \\(\\LaTeX\\) code in the same document, R-users could write in an .Rnw file using sweave or knitr. I still do so when I need the full flexibility of \\(\\LaTeX\\).\nUnfortunately, most psychology journals require submissions in MS Word (and most collaborators do as well). Learning \\(\\LaTeX\\) is fun for some people (e.g., me), but most will not bother. With the arrival of Rmarkdown, it became possible to automate document production with a system that takes just a few minutes to learn.\nThe papaja package by Frederick Aust uses Rmarkdown syntax and does a fantastic job of creating APA-style (6th Edition) documents in .pdf and gets close to perfect .docx output. With a bit of tweaking, papaja can do most of APA Style (7th Edition) for .pdf documents.\nMatti Vuore is working on an APA-like quarto extension that uses Typst instead of \\(\\LaTeX\\). As of 2024-02-27, there are aspects of APA style missing, but it looks promising. Because Typst offers many advantages over \\(\\LaTeX\\) (e.g., easy reconfiguration and much faster rendering), I would like to adapt apaquarto to use Typst as well. The development of Typst is fast and ongoing, so it will be interesting what the future holds."

It is made by Posit, the same company that makes Quarto. If you are an R user, you will probably want to select RStudio. Using the links there, 1) install R for your operation system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and 2) install RStudio Desktop.\nIf you use Python, Julia, or Observable as your primary tool for analyzing data, you can use RStudio, but using other tools you already know might be more comfortable (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter, NeoVim, or any other text editor). Some R users really like VS Code. Everyone has options—Quarto won’t box you in."

    "text": "Style guides are absolutely necessary for scientific documents Scholarly writing is often about inherently difficult topics, and style guides remove many avoidable barriers to communication. Information is much easier to absorb when presented in a predictable sequence and a familiar format. Still, in removing unnecessary barriers to communication on the reader’s end, style guides themselves often place unnecessary roadblocks before the writer.\nAPA style is fussier than most discipline-specific guides. Because it was introduced in the pre-computer age (Bentley et al. 1929), its quirks and charms resist easy automation. Even after decades of experience, I still need to look things up. Constantly. The basics of APA style are easy enough to learn, but there are a lot of particulars to keep in mind. Not only are there rules and exceptions to rules to remember, there are exceptions to the exceptions that must not be forgotten. I wrote apaquarto so that I would never have to worry about APA style ever again. With very little extra effort, your documents are formatted according to APA style (See Figure 1 for an example in “manuscript mode” and Figure 2 for the same document formatted like an APA journal).\n\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead.\n\n\nFigure 1: Example document in manuscript mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnable to display PDF file. Download instead.\n\n\nFigure 2: Example document in journal mode\n\n\n\n\nQuarto makes writing scientific documents easier\nThe apaquarto extension is built on Quarto, an open-source publishing system specifically adapted for scientific and technical documents such as journal articles, books, blogs, slides, and dashboards, and websites. Not only does Quarto offer considerable flexibility by itself, it was designed to be extensible. Thus, Quarto can take care of most of the formatting, and an extension can be written to handle whatever specific formatting rules a style guide requires. The apaquarto extension takes care of all the fussy details of APA-style so that you can focus on the content of your writing.\nYou do not need to know any programming languages to use Quarto. You can use it in a completely non-technical way to write well-formatted text, tables, figures, and references. However, if your document communicates the results from data analyses, then Quarto offers you something quite remarkable. You can perform your analyses and communicate your findings in the same file! That is, you write text and code together in a source document and then you “render” the document into its final format (e.g., .html, .pdf, .docx). So instead of performing your analyses elsewhere (e.g., SPSS) and then copying the results into a word processor (e.g., MS Word), you build your document in one step.\nThe advantages of this kind of workflow are profound. If you discover a mistake in your analysis, there is no need to find and replace the primary results and their downstream consequences scattered throughout the document. Instead, you just re-render the document, and everything in it is updated. When the document is published, the Quarto file serves as a fully reproducible record of your analysis. Making the Quarto file available in a public repository increases trust in your work because anyone can inspect it and trace any result you report back to the source code that created it.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBentley, Madison, CA Peerenboom, FW Hodge, Edward B Passano, HC Warren, and MF Washburn. 1929. “Instructions in Regard to Preparation of Manuscript.” Psychological Bulletin 26 (2): 57."

If you do this, make sure the affiliations are EXACTLY the same in every detail. Otherwise they will be listed as different. To make sure they are listed as the same affiliation, it is safer to use a reference id to make sure that there are no accidental differences that creep in to the editing process. In this example, the affiliation information was entered once, and the id was specified. For the second author with the same affiliation, the ref field is used to reference the previously specified id.\nauthor:\n  - name: William Joel Schneider\n    affiliations:\n      - name: Temple University\n        department: College of Education and Human Development\n        address: 1301 Cecil B.
