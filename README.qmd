This article template creates [APA Style 7th Edition documents](https://apastyle.apa.org/) in .docx, .html. and .pdf. Because the .docx format is still widely used---and often required---my main priority was to ensure compatibility for .docx. This is still a work in progress, and I encourage filing a "New Issue" on GitHub if something does not work of if there is a feature missing.

If you want to type in markdown to create a document in the APA 6th Edition format, I suggest using [papaja](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/).

If you need all the flexibility of $\LaTeX$, I suggest using the [apa7 document class](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7) with knitr and the [.Rnw format](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200552056-Using-Sweave-and-knitr).

## New in apaquarto 3.2.4

The main goal for version 3 was to do everything with lua filters instead of R. It was quite a journey, but apaquarto is now completely independent of R, which should help folks working with other languages.

### Breaking changes

* The the `apafg-` and `apatb-` prefixes are no longer used for figures and tables. Use the standard Quarto prefixes (`fig-` and `tbl-`), as well as the standard quarto referencing syntax (e.g,. `@fig-myplot` will reference the `fig-myplot` chunk.). 
*  The include statement below the metadata is no longer used and must be deleted. An informative error will provide instruction if the include statement remains. 

### Improvements

- The `floatsintext` option now works in docx and html. Setting it to `true`, intermingles text, figures, and tables. Setting it to `false` moves all figures and tables to the end of the document.
- The title page and abstract page are now processed using lua filters instead of R.
- The .docx running header is set with a lua filter and a docx field that draws from the .docx metadata. 
- The officer package is no longer required to create a new reference document every time the document is rendered.
- The jou (journal) mode in .pdf is better supported.
- Setting the `mask` field to true will mask all citations listed in the `masked-citations` field.
- Numbered lines available in .docx and .pdf formats when the `numbered-lines` field is set to `true`.

[Version History](NEWS.md)

## Creating a New Article

To create a new article using this format, run this command in the terminal:

``` bash
quarto use template wjschne/apaquarto
```

In RStudio, the terminal is a tab next to the console. If you cannot see a terminal tab next to the console, use the keyboard shortcut Alt-Shift-R to make a terminal appear.

Entering the command above will prompt a question about whether you trust the author of the extension to not run malicious code. If you answer Yes, you will be prompted to name a new folder where the extension will be installed with an example document with the name of the folder and a file extension of .qmd. The example document has most of the instructions you will likely need.

## Using with an Existing Document

To add this format to an existing document:

``` bash
quarto add wjschne/apaquarto
```

Then, add the format to your document options:

``` yaml
format:
  apaquarto-docx: default
```



Here is a minimal example of what the YAML metadata might look like:

``` yaml
