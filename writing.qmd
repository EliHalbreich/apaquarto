(Under Construction)

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) makes writing in a consistent style straightforward and easy. Its plain-text format was designed to be easy to read and easy to write, yet also flexible and specific enough that it could be converted automatically into fully formatted documents.

If you are used to writing with a word processor (e.g., MS Word, Google Docs), it might feel disconcerting to not see what the document will look like as you type. This feeling will pass, and the benefits of typing in a plain-text format will become evident. Formatting inconsistencies are much easier to spot and fix.

# Headings in APA Style

APA Style differentiates between [headings at 5 levels](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/headings). 
All headings should be in title case according to [these rules and exceptions](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case).

In markdown, a heading starts with the `#`, followed by a space, and then the text of the heading. The number of `#`s in a row determines the level of the heading:

``` md

# Level 1 Heading

## Level 2 Heading

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

##### Level 5 Heading

```

Quarto works best when there is at least one blank line above and below the heading. If you forget to follow this advice, Quarto will try its best, but it might not parse the document correctly.

## Level 1

APA-Style reserves a small number of level-1 headings with standard names:

-   Method
-   Results
-   Discussion
-   References
-   Appendices

There should be no level-1 heading for the introduction. The title acts as the heading for the introduction, and apaquarto places it there automatically.

## Levels 2--5

Readers are better able to follow your ideas if you differentiate long sections in your document with headings. I try limit my writing to just levels 1 and 2, but sometimes level 3 headings are needed. I am sparing to the point of stinginess with levels 4 and 5.





# What Can Follow a Heading

* Anything can follow immediately after headings at levels 1--3, including other headings. 
* Headings at levels 4 and 5 must have text paragraphs below them. Why? When rendered, level-4 and level-5 headings appear on the same line as the paragraphs they summarize.

``` md

# Level 1 Heading

This paragraph follows the level-1 heading.

## Level 2 Heading 

### This Level-3 Heading Directly Follows the Level-2 Heading.

This paragraph follows the level-3 heading.

#### Level 4 Heading

This paragraph will appear on the same line as the level-4 heading.

Subsequent paragraphs go on their own lines.

##### Level 5 Heading

This paragraph will appear on the same line as the level-5 heading.

Subsequent paragraphs go on their own lines.

```

# Figures

There are two ways to create figures: via code chunks or via markdown.

## Figures in Code Chunks

A [code chunk](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) (also known as *code blocks*) is a fenced section of a Quarto document that runs code. Quarto supports many languages, but I will focus on R.

Directly typing the three back ticks and the curly braces needed for a code chunk can be tedious. In RStudio, use the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd win=Ctrl-Alt-I mac=Cmd+Option+I >}} to create chunks. If keyboard shortcuts are hard to remember, there is a green button with a white "C" in RStudio's toolbar that creates code chunks. ![Insert Code Chunk Button](insertchunk.png){style='margin:0!important;height:30px'}

Once created, an empty chunk has three backticks <code>&grave;&grave;&grave;</code>, curly braces enclosing the name of the programming language (in this case, R): `{r}`, and another line of three backticks <code>&grave;&grave;&grave;</code> like so:

````{verbatim}
```{r}

```
````

:::{.column-margin}
Those are not single quotes (`'`) that fence in the code chunk. Those are backticks (<code>`</code>), which are usually above the Tab key on most keyboards in the US.

:::

At a minimum, an APA-Style figure needs a unique label with the `fig-` prefix, a caption specified with `fig-cap`, and code for the plot.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| label: fig-myplot
#| fig-cap: This is the figure caption.
plot(1:10)
```

[Code chunk options]https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options) like `label` and and `fig-cap` options are preceded by `#|`. They tell Quarto about how to run the code and present it the document. 



### Notes below Figures

```{r}
#| apa-note: "This is the note below the figure."
#| apa-twocolumn: true
```
